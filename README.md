# DiscordBot

This is a real simple bot, it'll post something when someone says a rude word and doesn't allow anyone to delete their messages to stop people trolling others

### Prerequisites

I don't know a lot about python so any tips or corrections I've made in the readme or code would be greatly appreciated 

Basic knowledge of python, python 3.8 installed and discord.py installed (Go to https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py and follow the instructions there if you don't have these installed)

### Installing

Download as a zip and open the discordBotScript.py file in pycharm or an ide of your choice, if you use pycharm you should probably change your project interpreter as well if it's not set to Python 3.8 unless you have discord.py in your venv

## Running the tests

There are no tests for this prototype
